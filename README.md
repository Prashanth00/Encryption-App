# Encryptor App

Introduction:
===============
        A simple encryption app to encrypt user data in android mobile phone. Hybrid encryption is used.
The data to be encrypted is split into three parts and encrypted with algorithms.

Algorithms used:
===============

Symmetric algorithms:
--------------------
        1.AES
        2.Salsa20
        3.Fernet

Asymmetric algorithm:
--------------------
        RSA algorithm(for encryption of provate keys)        

Feature:
===============
        The order of encryption of the algorithms are randomized.
